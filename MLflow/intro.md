## MLFlow Lab

This lab focuses on MLFlow, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle. It is based on the MLflow quickstart guide, which can be found [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html).

Databricks offers an extensive YouTube playlist for MLFlow, with a duration of approximately 3 hours. You can access the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3cxvsUFVZA&list=PLTPXxbhUt-YWjDg318nmSxRqTgZFWQ2ZC). (this maybe out of date for this version of MLFlow)
