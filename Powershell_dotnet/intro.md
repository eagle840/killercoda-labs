PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that was developed by Microsoft. It was built on top of the .NET Framework, which is a software framework developed by Microsoft that provides a large library of pre-built code and functionality for building applications. By leveraging the .NET Framework, PowerShell is able to access and utilize the vast array of libraries and APIs available in the .NET ecosystem, making it a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing systems, and scripting administrative tasks on Windows operating systems.
