# Step 3


## Asking for input

you can ask the user for input within a Makefile using the `$(shell)` function in combination with the `read` command. Here's an example:

```make
.PHONY: ask

ask:
    @echo "Please enter your name:"
    @read name; \
    echo "Hello, $$name!"
```

In this example, we define a target called `ask`. When you run `make ask`, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name, it will display a greeting message.

The `read` command is used to read the user input and store it in the `name` variable. Note that the `$$` is used to escape the variable in the shell command since we are executing it within the Makefile.

In a Makefile, the `.PHONY` target is a special target that is used to declare a target as phony or fake. Phony targets are targets that do not represent actual files or dependencies. Instead, they are used to define tasks or actions that need to be executed regardless of whether a file with the same name exists or not.

By declaring a target as `.PHONY`, you are telling Make that the target is not associated with a file and should always be considered out-of-date. This ensures that the associated commands are executed every time the target is invoked, regardless of the existence or modification time of any files with the same name.

## Docker


an example Makefile that demonstrates dependencies in a Docker context:

update the makefile

```
# Define variables
IMAGE_NAME = my_image
CONTAINER_NAME = my_container

# Define targets and dependencies
build: Dockerfile
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

run: build
	docker run --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(IMAGE_NAME)

stop:
	docker stop $(CONTAINER_NAME)

clean: stop
	docker rm $(CONTAINER_NAME)
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)
```

In this Makefile:

1. We define two variables, `IMAGE_NAME` and `CONTAINER_NAME`, which will be used to specify the name of the Docker image and container, respectively.

2. We define four targets: `build`, `run`, `stop`, and `clean`. The `build` target depends on the `Dockerfile` and will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. The `run` target depends on the `build` target and will run a container from the image with the specified name. The `stop` target will stop the running container. The `clean` target depends on the `stop` target and will remove the container and image.

3. Each target has a set of commands that use the Docker commands to build, run, stop, or remove the Docker resources.

Note that the `run` target depends on the `build` target, so if the Dockerfile is modified, the image will be rebuilt before running the container.
