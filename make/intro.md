This lab is the use of Make and Makefiles - for devops


Here are some key points to keep in mind when coding in Make:

1. Make is a build automation tool that is used to build executable programs and libraries from source code. It is also used to manage dependencies between files and to automate repetitive tasks.

2. Make uses a Makefile to define the rules and dependencies for building a project. A Makefile is a text file that contains a set of targets, dependencies, and commands.

3. Targets are the things that you want to build or accomplish. Each target in a Makefile is associated with a set of commands that are executed when the target is built.

4. Dependencies are the files or targets that a target depends on. If a dependency is modified, then the target is rebuilt.

5. Commands are the actions that are executed to build a target. Commands are executed in the order that they appear in the Makefile.

6. Variables can be defined in a Makefile to make it easier to manage complex projects. Variables can be used to store file paths, compiler options, and other project-specific information.

7. Make supports conditionals and loops, which can be used to create more complex build processes. Conditionals can be used to check for the existence of files or
