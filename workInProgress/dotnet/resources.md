## run vs publish

dotnet run, -> /bin/debug
dotnet publish -> /bin/Release

chatGPT:
To run the files generated by the `dotnet publish` command, you can navigate to the output folder where the published files are located and run the executable file for your application. On Windows, this will typically be an executable file with a `.exe` extension, while on macOS and Linux, it will be a file without an extension. You can run the executable from the command line by typing `./your_application_name` (on macOS and Linux) or `your_application_name.exe` (on Windows). Make sure to set the appropriate permissions if needed before running the executable.


## configuration

In the command 'dotnet build --configuration Release', the 'configuration' flag specifies the build configuration to use. In this case, 'Release' is the build configuration being specified. 

Build configurations are used to define different sets of build settings, such as optimization levels, debug information, and other compiler options. The 'Release' configuration is typically used for creating a production-ready build of the application, with optimizations enabled and debug information stripped out to improve performance. 

By specifying the 'Release' configuration, the 'dotnet build' command will build the project using the settings defined for the 'Release' configuration in the project file or any associated configuration files.


## setting

The appsettings.json file is a configuration file commonly used in .NET applications to store application settings and configuration data. It allows developers to define key-value pairs that can be accessed by the application at runtime. 

Some common uses of the appsettings.json file include:

1. Storing application settings such as database connection strings, API keys, and other configuration values.
2. Defining logging settings, such as log levels and log file paths.
3. Configuring feature toggles or flags to enable or disable certain application features.
4. Specifying environment-specific settings for different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

The appsettings.json file is typically located in the root directory of the .NET project and can be easily accessed and modified. It provides a flexible way to manage application configuration without hardcoding values in the code, making it easier to maintain and update settings as needed.
