# Running dotnet

## Dev vs prod mode

### Dev

by default, when you run a .NET application locally using the `dotnet run` command, it runs in development mode. This means that the application will use development-specific settings and configurations, such as more detailed logging, less aggressive caching, and other features that are helpful for development and debugging purposes.

In development mode, the .NET Core runtime provides additional features and tools to help developers during the development and testing phases of their application. Some of the key features of running a .NET application in development mode include:

1. **Detailed Logging**: The logging verbosity is usually increased in development mode, providing more detailed information about the application's behavior, which can be helpful for debugging purposes.

2. **Hot Reload**: Some frameworks and tools support hot reload in development mode, allowing you to make code changes and see the results immediately without restarting the application.

3. **Less Aggressive Caching**: Caching mechanisms may be less aggressive in development mode to make it easier to see changes reflected in the application without needing to clear caches manually.

4. **Error Handling**: Error messages and stack traces are often more detailed in development mode, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues during development.

5. **Development-specific Configurations**: The application may use development-specific configurations that are different from production settings, such as using a local database instead of a production database.

6. **Debugging Tools**: Development mode often enables additional debugging tools and features that can help you diagnose issues and step through code during development.

It's important to note that running an application in development mode is not suitable for production environments due to the additional overhead and potential security risks associated with the development-specific features. When you are ready to deploy your application to a production environment, you should build and run it in a production-ready configuration.

### Prod

To run your .NET application in production mode on your local PC, you can specify the environment explicitly when running the application. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Build the Application for Production**: First, you need to build your application for production. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

This command will build and publish your application in Release mode, which is optimized for production deployment.

2. **Run the Application in Production Mode**: After building the application for production, you can run it in production mode by setting the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `Production` before running the application. You can do this in the terminal before running your application:

```bash
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
dotnet run
```

By setting the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `Production`, your application will run in production mode, using production-specific configurations and settings.

3. **Verify Production Mode**: To verify that your application is running in production mode, you can check for any production-specific behaviors, such as reduced logging verbosity, optimized performance, and production database connections.

It's important to note that running your application in production mode on your local PC may not fully replicate a production environment. Consider testing your application in a staging environment that closely resembles your production environment before deploying it to production.

## FIne tuning

To fine-tune the behavior of your .NET Core application in each environment mode (Development, Production, Staging, Testing), you can customize various settings and configurations specific to each mode. Here are some common ways to fine-tune each mode:

1. **AppSettings Configuration**: Use the `appsettings.json` file to define environment-specific configurations for each mode. You can create separate configuration files like `appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.Production.json`, `appsettings.Staging.json`, and `appsettings.Testing.json` to override settings based on the environment.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set environment-specific variables in your application's launch settings or in the environment where the application is running. You can use environment variables to configure settings like database connections, API keys, and other sensitive information.

3. **Logging Configuration**: Customize logging settings for each environment mode to control the verbosity of logs, log output destinations, and log levels. You can configure logging providers like Console, Debug, EventLog, File, and more based on the environment.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Register services and dependencies specific to each environment mode using the built-in dependency injection container. You can conditionally register services based on the environment to provide different implementations or configurations.

5. **Middleware Configuration**: Configure middleware components in your application pipeline based on the environment mode. You can conditionally add or remove middleware components, change their order, or adjust their settings for each environment.

6. **Optimizations**: Optimize your application for performance, security, and scalability in production mode by enabling features like response caching, output caching, and compression. You can fine-tune these optimizations based on the specific requirements of each environment.

7. **Error Handling**: Customize error handling and exception logging based on the environment mode. You can configure how errors are handled, logged, and displayed to users in each environment to provide a better debugging and user experience.

By fine-tuning these settings and configurations for each environment mode, you can ensure that your .NET Core application behaves optimally in different environments while maintaining consistency and reliability across development, testing, staging, and production stages.
