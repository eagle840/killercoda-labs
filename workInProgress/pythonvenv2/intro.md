In this lab we explore way to have a successful Python experience (mainly on Linux, but alot applies to windows)

Each step is generally broken down into its own lab and not dependant on the others.


# using Python venv and troubleshooting dependiences



1. pip: pip is the default package manager for Python and is used to install and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It is widely used and comes pre-installed with most Python distributions, it is strongly suggested to use [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) along with this.

2. conda: conda is a package manager and environment manager that is commonly used in the data science and scientific computing communities. It allows you to create isolated environments with different versions of Python and packages, making it easier to manage dependencies.

3. poetry: poetry is a newer package manager for Python that aims to simplify dependency management and packaging. It provides a way to declare project dependencies in a pyproject.toml file and manages virtual environments for you.

4. pipenv: pipenv is a tool that combines pip and virtualenv into a single workflow. It automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your project and keeps track of dependencies in a Pipfile.
