# WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) HTTP server for running Python web applications.


Waitress for windows

Gunicorn for Linux

Using Waitress (or any WSGI server) to serve your Flask application instead of running it directly with `app.run()` has several advantages, especially in production environments:

1. **Performance**: WSGI servers like Waitress are designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently, making them more suitable for production use where multiple users may be accessing your application simultaneously. They are optimized for performance and can handle a higher volume of traffic compared to the Flask development server.

2. **Security**: WSGI servers like Waitress are typically more secure than the Flask development server. They are designed to be robust and handle security concerns such as handling HTTP headers, preventing common attacks, and managing server configurations securely.

3. **Scalability**: WSGI servers can be easily configured to run multiple instances of your Flask application, allowing you to scale your application horizontally to handle increased traffic and load. This scalability is essential for applications that need to grow and handle a large number of users.

4. **Reliability**: WSGI servers are more reliable and stable for long-running applications compared to the Flask development server, which is intended for development and testing purposes. WSGI servers are built to handle continuous operation and can be configured to automatically restart in case of failures.

5. **Deployment**: Using a WSGI server like Waitress allows you to deploy your Flask application in a production-ready manner. You can configure the server settings, manage logging, set up monitoring, and integrate with other tools for deployment and management.

While running your Flask application directly with `app.run()` during development is convenient and suitable for testing, using a WSGI server like Waitress in production environments provides better performance, security, scalability, reliability, and deployment capabilities. It ensures that your application is ready to handle real-world traffic and operate efficiently in a production setting.
