# Microsoft  SQL 2022

In this lab we'll be learning basic MS SQL preformance and tuning

We'll be using the AdventureworksLT database, available from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=ssms

Please note that the lab is set up as a learning experience and the code should never be used in production.
