# Step 6  Deployment and Testing

using docker


Section 6: Deployment and Testing with Docker

Description:
In this section, you will learn how to deploy your Ruby on Rails application using Docker, a popular containerization platform. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments. We will also cover writing tests for your Rails application and integrating them into the Docker deployment process.

Code:

1. Dockerfile:
```
# Base image
FROM ruby:2.7.2

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs

# Install Rails gem
RUN gem install rails

# Copy Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN bundle install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV RAILS_ENV=production

# Precompile assets
RUN bundle exec rails assets:precompile

# Start the Rails server
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

2. docker-compose.yml:
```
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:12
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp_production
```

3. Writing Tests:
- Install the necessary testing gems in your Gemfile:
```
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'factory_bot_rails'
  gem 'faker'
end
```
- Run `bundle install` to install the gems.
- Generate the RSpec configuration files:
```
rails generate rspec:install
```
- Write your tests in the `spec` directory using RSpec syntax.

4. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitLab CI.
- Configure the pipeline to build the Docker image and run the tests.
- Push the Docker image to a container registry.
- Deploy the Docker image to your production environment using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

Note: Make sure to update the database configuration in your Rails application to use the environment variables provided by Docker Compose.

With this setup, you can easily deploy your Ruby on Rails application using Docker, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments and simplifying the deployment process.
