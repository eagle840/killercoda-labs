Congratulations! You have successfully built a complete monitoring pipeline using the TIG stack.

In this lab, you learned how to:
-   Deploy Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana in Docker.
-   Configure Telegraf to collect system metrics.
-   Verify that metrics are being stored in InfluxDB.
-   Connect Grafana to InfluxDB and build a dashboard to visualize your data.

This setup is a powerful foundation for monitoring any system or application.
