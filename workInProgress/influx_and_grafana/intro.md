Welcome to this hands-on lab where you will build a complete monitoring solution for an Ubuntu host using the popular TIG stack: **T**elegraf, **I**nfluxDB, and **G**rafana.

In this scenario, you will:
-   Deploy InfluxDB, Telegraf, and Grafana using Docker Compose.
-   Configure Telegraf to collect system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
-   Store the collected metrics in InfluxDB, a time-series database.
-   Connect Grafana to InfluxDB and build a dashboard to visualize the metrics in real-time.

By the end of this lab, you will have a functional and powerful monitoring pipeline.
