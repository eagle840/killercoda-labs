an example Makefile that demonstrates how to use conditionals in a Makefile:

```
# Define variables
APP_NAME = my_app
APP_VERSION = 1.0.0
APP_PORT = 8080
APP_ENV = development

# Define targets and dependencies
build:
ifeq ($(APP_ENV), production)
	docker build -t $(APP_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) -f Dockerfile.prod .
else
	docker build -t $(APP_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) .
endif

run: build
	docker run --name $(APP_NAME) -p $(APP_PORT):$(APP_PORT) -e NODE_ENV=$(APP_ENV) $(APP_NAME):$(APP_VERSION)

stop:
	docker stop $(APP_NAME)

clean: stop
	docker rm $(APP_NAME)
```

In this Makefile:

1. We define variables at the top of the Makefile using the `VARNAME = value` syntax. In this case, we define variables for the `APP_NAME`, `APP_VERSION`, `APP_PORT`, and `APP_ENV`.

2. We define four targets: `build`, `run`, `stop`, and `clean`. The `build` target uses a conditional to determine which Dockerfile to use based on the `APP_ENV` variable. If the `APP_ENV` is set to `production`, it uses the `Dockerfile.prod` file. Otherwise, it uses the default `Dockerfile`. The `run` target runs a container from the image with the specified name, port, and environment variables. The `stop` target stops the running container. The `clean` target stops and removes the container.

3. The conditional uses the `ifeq ($(VARNAME), value)` syntax to compare the value of the `APP_ENV` variable to the string `production`. If the values match, it executes the commands in the first block. Otherwise, it executes the commands in the second block.

By using conditionals in the Makefile, we can customize the build process based on the value of a variable. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the Makefile for different environments and configurations.

I hope this example helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to cover anything else
