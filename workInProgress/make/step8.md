an example of using conditionals in a Makefile to check for the existence of a file:

```
ifeq "$(wildcard file.txt)" ""
$(error file.txt not found)
endif
```

In this example, the `ifeq` statement is used to check if the file `file.txt` exists. If the file does not exist, then the `$(error)` function is called with a message informing the user that the file is not found.

The `wildcard` function is used to check for the existence of a file. If the file exists, then the function returns the name of the file. If the file does not exist, then the function returns an empty string.

In a Makefile, ":=" is a variable assignment operator that indicates immediate expansion of the variable. This means that the value assigned to the variable is expanded and assigned at the time of definition, rather than during later occurrences of the variable in the Makefile.

For example, consider the following Makefile:

```
FOO := $(BAR)
BAR := hello
```

In this example, if we expand $(FOO), we get an empty value because the expansion of $(BAR) has not yet occurred when it was assigned to $(FOO). However, if we used "=" instead of ":=", the value of $(BAR) would only be assigned to $(FOO) when $(FOO) is used later in the Makefile.

Therefore, ":=" is used when we want immediate expansion of the variable, i.e., the value of the variable right now, while "=" is used when we want deferred expansion, i.e., the value of the variable when it is used later in the Makefile.
