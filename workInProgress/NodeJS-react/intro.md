# Welcome to Modern Frontend Development with React and Vite!

Frontend development has evolved rapidly, and tools like React, JSX, and Vite are at the forefront of this change. This lab provides a hands-on guide to building a modern web application using these powerful technologies.

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. It combines the expressiveness of JavaScript with a familiar HTML-like template syntax.

In this lab, you will:
1.  Install Node.js using NVM (Node Version Manager).
2.  Create a new React application from scratch using the Vite build tool.
3.  Learn basic JSX syntax and update a React component.

Let's get started!
