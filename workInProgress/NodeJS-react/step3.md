# Step 3: Understanding JSX and Updating Your App

Now that you have a running React application, let's dive into **JSX**, the syntax that makes writing React components so intuitive.

### 1. What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript files. It's the standard way to build component UIs in React.

Here's a basic example. Notice how you can embed JavaScript variables directly inside the HTML-like tags using curly braces `{}`.

```jsx
const name = "World";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>; // This renders as "Hello, World!"
```

### 2. Update the `App.jsx` Component

Let's apply this to your application. I will now overwrite the content of `src/App.jsx` with a new component that uses this syntax.

`echo 'import React from "react";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const name = "User";\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>\n      <p>Welcome to your new React app, powered by Vite.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;' > my-app/src/App.jsx`{{exec}}

After the command runs, your browser preview should automatically update to show the new content. This is **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** in action‚Äîa key feature of Vite that speeds up development.

### 3. The Broader Tooling Landscape

While we are using Vite, it's helpful to know about other tools. The tables from your notes are included below for reference.
