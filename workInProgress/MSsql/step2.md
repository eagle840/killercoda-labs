## üîê Logon Account vs üìÇ Database Account in SQL Server

Understanding the distinction between **logon accounts** and **database accounts** is key to managing access in SQL Server.

### üîê Logon Account (Login)
- **Scope**: Server-level
- **Purpose**: Authenticates a user to the SQL Server instance
- **Created with**: `CREATE LOGIN`
- **Examples**:
  - SQL Server authentication:
    ```sql
    CREATE LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword';
    ```
  - Windows authentication:
    ```sql
    CREATE LOGIN [DOMAIN\User] FROM WINDOWS;
    ```
- **Note**: A login does **not** automatically grant access to any database.

---

### üìÇ Database Account (User)
- **Scope**: Database-level
- **Purpose**: Authorizes a login to access a specific database
- **Created with**: `CREATE USER`
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  USE [YourDatabase];
  CREATE USER [your_login_name] 
  FOR LOGIN [your_login_name];
  ```

 - To grant **roles/permissions**:
  ```
  ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [your_login_name];
  ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [your_login_name];
   ```


## Single user mode

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
GO
```

- SINGLE_USER: Restricts access to one user at a time.
- WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE: Forces disconnect of all other users and rolls back their transactions immediately.


# üß≥ Contained Databases in SQL Server

Contained databases are a powerful feature in SQL Server that simplify database management, improve portability, and reduce dependency on the host SQL Server instance. Unlike traditional databases, contained databases can manage authentication and configuration internally‚Äîmaking them ideal for cloud, multi-tenant, or migration-heavy environments.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/contained-databases?view=sql-server-ver17

---

## üîç What Is a Contained Database?

A **contained database** is a self-sufficient SQL Server database that minimizes reliance on the SQL Server instance. It includes its own:

- Metadata
- Authentication (via contained users)
- Configuration settings

This allows the database to be moved between servers without breaking user access or requiring server-level login recreation.

---

## üîê Contained Users vs Traditional Logins

| Feature                  | Traditional Database | Contained Database       |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Authentication Scope     | Server-level login   | Database-level user       |
| Migration Complexity     | High (logins must be recreated) | Low (users travel with DB) |
| Setup                    | Login + User mapping | Direct user creation      |

### ‚úÖ Traditional Setup

```sql
-- Server-level login
CREATE LOGIN app_user WITH PASSWORD = 'StrongP@ssword';

-- Database-level user
USE MyDatabase;
CREATE USER app_user FOR LOGIN app_user;

-- Directly inside the contained database
CREATE USER contained_user WITH PASSWORD = 'SecureP@ss123!';
```

## Enabling

Before using contained databases, enable the feature at the server level:

```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
EXEC sp_configure 'contained database authentication', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
```

and create a contained db

```sql
CREATE DATABASE MyContainedDB
CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Administrative Tasks for SQL Server DBAs

A SQL Database Administrator (DBA) plays a critical role in managing and maintaining SQL Server environments. Below is a categorized list of typical responsibilities:

---

### 1. üì¶ Database Creation and Configuration
- Create new databases
- Configure file sizes, growth rates, and recovery models
- Set collation and compatibility levels

---

### 2. üîê User and Security Management
- Create logins and database users
- Assign roles and permissions
- Implement Windows and SQL Server authentication
- Audit and monitor access

---

### 3. üíæ Backup and Recovery
- Schedule full, differential, and transaction log backups
- Restore databases from backups
- Test disaster recovery procedures

---

### 4. üöÄ Performance Monitoring and Tuning
- Monitor query performance and server health
- Create and maintain indexes
- Update statistics
- Use tools like SQL Profiler, Extended Events, and Query Store

---

### 5. üßπ Maintenance and Housekeeping
- Run regular maintenance tasks (e.g., DBCC CHECKDB, index rebuilds)
- Clean up old data or logs
- Archive historical data

---

### 6. üîÑ High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR)
- Configure Always On Availability Groups
- Set up database mirroring or log shipping
- Manage failover clusters

---

### 7. ü§ñ Automation and Scripting
- Write T-SQL scripts for routine tasks
- Use SQL Agent for job scheduling
- Implement PowerShell for advanced automation

---

### 8. üì£ Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up alerts for failed jobs, low disk space, or high CPU usage
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., SentryOne, SolarWinds)

---

### 9. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrades and Patching
- Apply service packs and cumulative updates
- Migrate databases between versions or servers

---

### 10. ‚úÖ Compliance and Auditing
- Ensure data protection and privacy (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
- Track changes and access for compliance audits

---

These tasks help ensure that SQL Server environments are secure, performant, and resilient.
