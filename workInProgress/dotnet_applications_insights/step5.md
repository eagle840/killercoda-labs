chapgpt notes

When you run `dotnet new webapp` and `dotnet new blazor`, you are creating two different types of projects in the .NET ecosystem.

1. `dotnet new webapp`: This command creates a new ASP.NET Core web application project using the Razor Pages framework. Razor Pages is a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. The directory structure for a Razor Pages project typically includes folders like `Pages`, `wwwroot`, `Controllers`, `Models`, and `Views`.

2. `dotnet new blazor`: This command creates a new Blazor project, which is a web framework for building interactive web UIs using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. Blazor allows you to build client-side web applications with rich interactivity and real-time updates. The directory structure for a Blazor project includes folders like `Pages`, `wwwroot`, `Shared`, and `wwwroot`.

The main difference in the directory structure between the two project types is due to the different frameworks and paradigms they follow. Razor Pages projects are more traditional web applications with server-side rendering, while Blazor projects are modern single-page applications that run on the client side using WebAssembly.

If you are looking to build a modern web application with interactive UI components and real-time updates, Blazor might be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more traditional web development approach with server-side rendering, Razor Pages could be the way to go.
