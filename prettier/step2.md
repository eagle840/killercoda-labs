Setup pre-commit hook to run prettier before a commit https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html#git-hooks


WIP CHatGPT:

In the context of Git, a pre-commit hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is made. It allows you to perform checks or tasks to ensure the commit meets certain criteria or follows specific guidelines. As a Linux engineer, you can utilize pre-commit hooks to enforce standards, run tests, or perform any other necessary actions before committing changes to a Git repository.

To set up a pre-commit hook:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Git repository.
2. Locate the `.git/hooks` directory. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
3. Create a new file named `pre-commit` inside the `.git/hooks` directory.
4. Make the file executable by running the command `chmod +x pre-commit`.
5. Open the `pre-commit` file in a text editor and write your desired script or commands.
