# Step 4 NPX

`npx` is a command-line tool that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager) and is used to execute Node.js packages directly without the need to install them globally or locally. It allows you to run a package from the npm registry as if it were installed on your machine.

Some key features and use cases of `npx` include:

1. **Running CLI tools**: You can run command-line tools and scripts directly from the npm registry without installing them globally or locally. This is useful for running one-off commands or tools that you don't want to install permanently.

2. **Executing specific package versions**: `npx` allows you to specify a specific version of a package to run, which can be helpful for testing compatibility or running scripts with specific dependencies.

3. **Running binaries from dependencies**: You can run binaries from dependencies listed in the `package.json` file without having to install them globally. This is useful for running project-specific tools or scripts.

4. **Executing scripts**: `npx` can be used to run scripts defined in the `package.json` file under the `scripts` section. This is commonly used for running build scripts, test scripts, or other custom scripts in Node.js projects.

Overall, `npx` simplifies the process of running Node.js packages and scripts by providing a convenient way to execute them without the need for manual installation. It helps manage dependencies and ensures that the correct version of a package is used for a specific task.
