Start another scenario for more complex tcpdump


CUT OUT OF ORGINAL
ts isp connections

ping  checking the timeouts for
    local gw
    8.8.8.8

    tracert 8.8.8.8

    check router for its, ISP ip and gw
    try pinging those 2 see timeout
    try pinging with '-l'  allows your to set size (what about fragmenst)

hopefully the tracert will return an ASN number
lookit up  - give websites
Try connecting to looking glass server and back tracert
try a speed test - give websites
ping while running speed test (to local asn router)
