This lab is for a Redis server and Redis Stack setup.

Redis Server is the core component of Redis, an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It provides fundamental data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets with range queries, and supports various features like transactions, pub/sub, and Lua scripting.

Redis Stack, on the other hand, extends the capabilities of Redis Server by bundling additional tools and modules to create a more comprehensive data platform. It includes modules like RediSearch for full-text search, RedisGraph for graph database capabilities, RedisTimeSeries for time-series data, and RedisJSON for JSON data type support, among others. Redis Stack aims to provide an all-in-one solution for various complex data needs while maintaining the performance and simplicity of Redis Server.
