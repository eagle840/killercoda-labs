Welcome to the Basic BentoML setup lab!

BentoML is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of creating machine learning-powered prediction services, making them ready for deployment and scaling. With BentoML, you can easily package your trained ML models into a production-ready format, allowing you to serve predictions in a scalable and efficient manner.

To get started, let's explore what BentoML has to offer. Visit BentoML's website at https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/index.html to learn more about its features and capabilities.

One of the key advantages of BentoML is its compatibility with various ML training models. Whether you're using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other popular frameworks, BentoML seamlessly integrates with them. Check out the supported frameworks at https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html to see if your preferred framework is on the list.

In this lab, we will guide you through the process of setting up a basic BentoML environment. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid foundation to start building and deploying ML-powered prediction services using BentoML. Let's get started!
